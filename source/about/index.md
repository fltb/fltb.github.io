I used to persuade others to open a personal blog many times, and now I started a blog myself.

Of course, the blog is a place to put some articles on. I've written several, and most of them haven't been published yet. After this blog is established, I will put many of my stuff on, which contains some technical blog or some essay. But it's hard to tell. You know this is only the beginning, after all.

When I was a child, I wasn't like writing very much. When my primary school assigned diary homework to me, I scribbled it casually, gather around 200 characters (around 60 words), then account for it. I suspect that my skill of talking nonsense was practiced at that time. Besides, when composition homework have been assigned, I was nearly crazy. Striking my hair, with a sharpened pencil hovered one centimeter above the paper, I thought desperately about what should be written. Hours passed and the manuscript paper remained blank. Once I delayed for several hours, then forced me to write. Then I finished. After a few months, this article had been posted in a small local newspaper's *Students Arcitcal* column. My parents showed me a brand-new ten yuan note (Chinese currency), telling me that's my royalties. I haven't seen that article again and never wanted to see that.

I like reading books, all kinds of books. When a book was completed, I put it down and then began to read another, without taking notes or writing any book reviews. There was some book review homework that I just copied the preface or postscript of these books to handle. There used to have several boxes of books in my home, but most of them were given to others now. I merely read books for several hours, then began to write homework till midnight.

In the past two years, I started to write something on my own, ranging from diaries to blogs, which were written at will. For instance, some plum petals that were crushed by pedestrians' shoes drifting in the mud on a rainy night in early spring, some fallen leaves rolled up in the gust of wind in late autumn, or the long silhouette in the middle of the pavement dyed dark red by the sunlight, all could be the content of my article. After this blog is opened, these articles will be posted here gradually.

This blog uses English as the default language, though I am good at writing in Chinese. But due to some political concerns, I'd better not use Chinese directly, although this site is on Github Pages. If there is an English site on the surface, it may not like to be closed. I don't know how long this blog will be open, but as long as I can still visit it, I will not stop to update it.
