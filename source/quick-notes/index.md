Sometimes I have brief thoughts that I want to jot down casually, but writing them as a full blog post feels too formal. So, I decided to create a dedicated page to record these fleeting ideas.

To make it more convenient, I will jot down these thoughts in the comments. If Giscus is temporarily unavailable, you can directly check them on GitHub Discussions.

This English page is unlikely to be updated frequently, so it's best to check the [Chinese page](/zh-cn/quick-notes) for the latest content.
