## Before Start

Last summer holiday I notice the Witcher 3 had a decent discount on GOG, so I brought it with 30 more yuan (around $5). But I found myself stuck at the *Wandering in the dark* task since my skill was bad at that time. Besides, I hadn't helped the girl hurt by Griffin at White Orchard and made irresponsible remarks when reporting to the Emperor. After all, this time I started a new save, deciding to play in a better way.

This time I prepare to fine-tuning Geralt's view. In my opinion, the process is just exporting the model to Blender, editing it, then import to game, which is really fast. But I spent 3 days ultimately. Due to the lack of documentation, I had to guess what should I do through massive tutorials. All the tool needed shall be run on Windows, so I installed a Windows 10 LTSC on VirtualBox. I installed wcc_lite, WolvelKit, etc. Packing, Unpacking, Cooking, Uncooking, importing, exporting, I was tired with these endless tasks. The 3-D model had been competed already, but the textures were missing again and again. At last, I edited w2mesh file manually to add the texture path, and got a different ending - the game crashed. I gave up.

It seems that I still underestimated the difficulty of game development.
